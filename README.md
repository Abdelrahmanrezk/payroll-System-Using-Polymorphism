Case Study: payroll System Using Polymorphism

### Problem Statements

A company pays its employees on a weekly basis. The employees are of four types: Salariedemployees are paid a fixed weekly salary regardless of the number of hours worked, hourlyemployees are paid by the hour and receive overtime pay (i.e., 1.5 times their hourly sal-ary rate) for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours, commission employees are paid a per-centage of their sales and base-salaried commission employees receive a base salary plus apercentage of their sales. For the current pay period, the company has decided to rewardsalaried-commission  employees  by  adding  10%  to  their  base  salaries.  The  companywants you to write an application that performs its payroll calculations polymorphically.
